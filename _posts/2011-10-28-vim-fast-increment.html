        Today I found out about a useful feature of Vim that allows to
        increment or decrement a numeric value using keyboard shortcuts.
        To use it, enter normal mode (press <b>ESC</b>), place the
        cursor on top of the number (anywhere), and press
        <b>CTRL+A</b> to increment or <b>CTRL+X</b> to decrement.
        The increment is made by one unit.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        This shortcuts also work with dates, but on the last two
        components of the date (depending on the format), let's say
        month and day, if I use the format yyyy-mm-dd, the commands
        are going to be reverted, meaning that to increment you have to
        use <b>CTRL+X</b> and to decrement <b>CTRL+A</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        I found this shortcuts very useful while working with stylesheets,
        adjusting margin, padding, and size values.

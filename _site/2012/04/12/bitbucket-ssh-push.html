    <h2>Bitbucket SSH push</h2>
    <p>
        I have a private git project hosted on both
        Bitbucket and Github using git remotes.<br>
        The 'first world problem' that I had using this configuration,
        besides having to push two times, once for the Bitbucket repo,
        and once for the Github copy, was that, although I had setup
        my SSH key on Bitbucket it still asked me for a password
        on each push.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why? Well after a bit of research on StackOverflow I found out
        that it was because: in my <b>.git/config</b> file, the url of
        the Bitbucket remote was in the format:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
            [remote "origin"]<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;url = https://username@bitbucket.org/username/reponame.git<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus forcing the password request on every action, for the ssh
        tunneling. The solution?<br>
        Using the git protocol format:
    </p>
    <p class="code">
            [remote "origin"]<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;url = git@bitbucket.org:username/reponame.git<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        That's all, now I can push using only the SSH key. I still have to push
        twice, but that is another issue, and until I can find a platform independent
        solution for that I'll have to deal with it.

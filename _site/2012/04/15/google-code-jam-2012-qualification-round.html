    <h2> Google Code Jam 2012 Qualification Round </h2>
    <p>
	This year the qualification round consisted of 4 problems. As lately
	I have been using Ruby I decided to try my luck with it, and avoid 
	writing all the Java boilerplate code to do simple things like reading
	and parsing a text file. I am using Ubuntu 12.04 installed in VirtualBox 4.1.12
    </p> 
    <p>
	The competition started at 01:00 AM in my country, but nevertheless I stayed up
	and tried (and solved) at least one of the problems before sleep kicked in. These
	are the solutions I came up with under the circumstances.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Problem A: Speaking in Tongues</h3>
    <p> This one was the first I tried, and in my opinion the easiest of the set. The
	explanation and the hints made very clear what was to do. This solution gave me 
	15 points:

    <h3>Problem B: Dancing With the Googlers</h3>
    <p>
    I think I overcomplicated this one, but I managed to obtain a solution, not a final
    one as I missed a case, because the large input failed.
    </p>
    <p> 
    My solution solved the small input, but failed with the large one, so this gave me only
    10 points.
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/2392461.js"> </script>
    
    <h3>Problem C: Recycled Numbers</h3>
    <p>
    This one was a bit tricky because there were some unspecified cases that the solution
    had to deal with, like the permutations of same digit numbers (1111 is the same
    as 1111 although some of the 1's are exchanged) which you were not supposed to consider.  
    </p>
    <p>
    This solved the small input, and eventually the large one, but not in the required 8 
    minutes (it took ~11 minutes). So I only gained 10 points for the small input.
    </p>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/2392495.js"> </script>
    
    <p>
    I had no time left to try the last one, but with the accumulated score of 35 I qualified 
    for the next round, so I am happy with that.
    </p>
    <p>
    I think that for the next round I will install ruby natively on my windows machine, to 
    gain some CPU power for the large inputs, and maybe be able to solve them in time.
    </p>
    <p>
    See you on April 28th on Round 1!
